# Yeeva's mapping of the 52 playing cards to the 78 tarot cards

This is a [practice tool](https://rentalsatyr8499.github.io/78to52/practice.html) and [guide](https://rentalsatyr8499.github.io/78to52/guide.html) to a tarot-reading technique that only requires a 52-deck of playing cards (not an actual deck of tarot cards). 

## To play

The tool and guide are live on [Github pages](https://rentalsatyr8499.github.io/78to52/).

## To modify

If you'd like to repurpose the [practice tool](https://rentalsatyr8499.github.io/78to52/practice.html) to reflect your own mapping, and you know JavaScript, I encourage you to fork this repo and make your own modifications to the game's mapping logic, which is encapsulated in the [js/logic getAnswer](https://github.com/RentalSatyr8499/78to52/blob/main/js/logic.js) function.
