    <h2 id="intro">The idea</h2>
    <p>This technique involves drawing cards from an unmarked 52-card playing deck in such a way that there is exactly a 1 in 78 chance of drawing any meaningful combination of cards. There are still some probabilistic differences between using this technique and using an actual tarot deck, but the two are very close.</p>

    <h2 id="procedure">How to deal</h2>
    <p> Here are the steps to do a 3-card-spread tarot reading using a 52-card deck. It's easily adoptable to do any kind of spread.
    <ol>
        <li>The querent shuffles the 52 playing cards while thinking of their question.</li>
        <li>The reader takes the deck and selects 3 groups of four cards: each group must contain one card of each suit. So 12 cards total are being drawn in this step (three spades, three clubs, etc.) </li>
        <li>Lay these groups out face down for the querent so that each group can be clearly identified. The querent can continue shuffling the cards more if desired.</li>

            </div>
        <li>The querent draws three cards and places them in a row.</li>

                <img src="resources/images/guide/2.png" alt="2.png">
            </div>
        <li>The querent draws two cards from each of the three four-card groups, and places them in columns below the first three cards (see animation). In total, the querent should have drawn nine cards by this point.</li>

            </div>
        <li>The cards are flipped over for interpretation.</li>

    </p>

    <h2 id="interpretation">How to read</h2>
    <p>You might say, "Yeeva, drawing three cards from the deck results in a 1 in 132,600 chance of drawing any combination! That's a lot more than 1 in 78!" To that I say: this is where the magic happens!..</p>
    <p>Cards are interpreted so that each 3-card column corresponds to a Rider-Waite-Smith tarot card:</p>
        <div class="centeredImage">
                <img src="resources/images/guide/5.png" alt="5.png">
        </div>
    <ol>
        <li>If the two bottom cards of the column are different colors, then it's a minor arcana.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The rank (number) of the top card is the number of the tarot card. Ace is ace, 2 is two, etc... Jack is knight, Q is queen, and K is king. Ignore the Pages for now; their mappings are explained below.</li>
            <li>The suit of the tarot is determined by the suit of the second card.
                <ul>
                    <li>Diamonds: pentacles</li>
                    <li>Hearts: cups</li>
                    <li>Clubs: wands</li>
                    <li>Spades: swords</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li>If the two bottom cards of the column are the same color, then it's probably a major arcana.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>If they are red: the tarot is in the first half of the major arcana. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The top card tells you which tarot it is exactly: ace for The Magician, 2 for The High Priestess, 3 for The Empress...all the way to K for Death.</li>
                    <li>I prefer to start at The Magician for ace, instead of The Fool, because the numbers on the tarot cards line up with the card's rank.</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>Similarly, if the two bottom cards are black, the tarot is in the second half of the major arcana. The top card's rank again points to the specific card: ace for Temperance, 2 for The Devil...all the way up to 8 for The World.
            This still leaves us with five unmapped cards (when the bottom cards are black). I map them as the following: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>9 is The Fool.</li>
                    <li>10 is The Page of Pentacles.</li>
                    <li>J is The Page of Cups.</li>
                    <li>Q is The Page of Wands.</li>   
                    <li>K is The Page of Swords.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li>If the top card is black, the tarot is upright. If it's red, the tarot is reversed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="memorizing">Memorizing</h2>
    <p>After understanding how to map a 3-card column to a tarot, it's simply a matter of memorizing. Memorizing which tarot suits corresponding which card suits is pretty straightforward, because you just have to think about their meanings: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pentacles talk about wealth and materialism, so they get assigned to diamonds.</li>
        <li>Cups are about love and emotions of course. So they get hearts.</li>
        <li>By process of elimination, clubs get assigned to wands.</li>
        <li>Swords are weapons, and spades also kind of look like a weapon (maybe a spearhead).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now how to remember what the reds mean and what the blacks mean. In my head, in comparison to black, red represents something deficient or something with a caveat that you have to be careful about. This is especially in contrast against the white background of the cards, where red is in lower contrast than the stark contrast of black against white. Also, the weaker suits (diamonds, hearts) are red, and the stronger ones are black. In this way, I remember that red corresponds to a reversed card. A simple trick could also be just to think R is for Red and Reversed. But also, I use these thematic associations to remember that when the bottom two cards are red, the top card pulls from the first (or "lower") half of the minor arcana. Because you are earlier in the Fool's journey, and are therefore weaker/closer to the "red" than you are to "black".</p>
    <nl></nl>
    <p>The final thing to memorize is the mapping of card ranks to the major arcana and the four Pages. This is the only part of this technique that really involves brute memorization. Although if you already have a mental association between each major arcana and the number that is written on their Rider-Waite-Smith illustration, this part may come more easily.</p>

    <p>In order to practice these rules, I've made <a href="practice.html">this tool</a> that allows you to practice your ability to recognize tarot mappings from 3-card columns.</p>
    <h2 id="notes">Further notes</h2>
    <h3>How is it that we only get a 1 in 78 chance of drawing any 3-card column (instead of a 1 in 52*51*50 chance)?</h3>
    <p>We only use limited information from the bottom two cards to discern the column's tarot mapping, which reduces the map's range to exactly 78. Specifically, this is how it works: note that 6*13 = 78 (lucky! 52 and 78 are both divisible by 13!). So we can achieve a 1 in 78 probability by drawing independently from a 13-card pile and independently from a 6-card pile. By only accounting for the rank of the top card, drawing the top card functionally acts as drawing from a 13-card pile (because there is no difference between the top card being a 3 of diamonds and a 3 of clubs - either way, we only use the number 3 to determine the tarot).</p><nl></nl><p>This leaves us with our 6-card pile. This is achieved with our special 4-card "one of each suit piles", which is where we derive our two bottom cards from. There are only 6 possible combinations that we can draw from these piles that matter to us: diamond middle + black on bottom, heart middle + black bottom, club middle + red bottom, spade middle + red bottom, two blacks, and two reds. There is an equal chance of drawing any of these six middle-bottom card combinations, because there is a 4*3 = 12 chance of drawing any two-card combination, which collapses into 6 different possibilities because we don't care about certain suit identities (I'll leave this proof as an exercise to the reader).</p><nl></nl><p>This gives us exactly 78 different ways to interpret any 3-card column, not including reversed cards. The number of interpretations is multiplied by exactly 2 when we add the "red is reversed" rule to the top card, reflecting the fact that there are 156 possible oriented tarots you can draw from a deck.</p>
    <h3>Modifying the system</h3>
    <p>There are lots of modifications you can make to this system that preserve its uniformity (i.e. every tarot card has an equal chance of being drawn). For example, if it's easier for you to remember, you can move The Fool to the first half of the major arcana (map it to Ace, and shift all subsequent major arcanas down by one). Or you can map J (jacks) to Pages instead of Knights, and move Knights to the overflow area in the second half of the major arcana (two black bottom cards). I also believe you can change the minor arcana suit to depend on the top card instead of the middle card, and have the color of the middle card determine the orientation of the tarot. Of course, you can always also find some way to map the cards to a different tradition than RWS. All of these modifications preserve the fairness of the system towards any particular tarot.</p><nl></nl><p>Some modifications you can't make: for example, whatever card determines the suit of the minor arcana cannot also determine the orientation of the tarot. If this were the case, then red suits (pentacles and cups) will always be reversed. You also cannot omit the step where the 4-card "one of each suit" piles are used. As explained in the previous question, the fairness of the system depends on drawing twice from a 4-card pile without replacement. For this reason, it's also not really possible to reduce the 3-card column to a 2-card column. However I think it's probably possible to increase the number of cards and maintain a fair system.</p><nl></nl><p>If you'd like to repurpose the <a href="practice.html">practice tool</a> to reflect your own mapping, and you know JavaScript, I encourage you to fork my <a href="https://github.com/RentalSatyr8499/78to52">Github repo</a> and make your own modifications to the game's mapping logic, which is encapsulated in the js/logic getAnswer function.</p>
    <h3>Deficiencies (or differences)</h3>
    <p>Like I said in the beginning, there are still differences between using this technique and using an actual tarot card deck. When you draw a card from an actual tarot deck, the chance that you draw any given card next becomes 1 in 77. But when you draw a card using this system, certain other cards become slightly more likely than others to be drawn next. For example, if you drew an upright second-half major arcana card (3 blacks), you're more likely to draw a reversed first-half major arcana next (3 reds), than you are to draw another upright second-half major arcana (3 blacks). Like if you drew an upright Star, the chance that you draw a reversed Magician next is higher than the chance of you drawing an upright Moon. But in an actual tarot deck their likelihoods of being drawn next would be exactly equal. This is a deficiency in that the 52-card system slightly diverges from the 78-card system once multiple cards are drawn. But you might see it as a plus because the increased interdependency between cards who have connected meanings increases the diversity of the tarots that you'll draw in a given reading (I think).</p><nl></nl><p>The way card orientations work is also very different from that of a traditional tarot deck, too. When I read from my tarot deck, the orientation of a given card depends on where I decided to cut the deck and rotate some cards, or how I slid the cards back into the box the last time I used them, or how exactly I handed the deck to my friend. There are a lot of little physical interactions influenced by the universe and my own subconscious actions that lead to the reversal of a tarot card. If you believe that this is a more natural and connected way of gleaning a reading that really came from the universe, then the red reversal rule of my 52-card system is kind of a drawback, because it leaves tarot orientation up to the same mechanisms that tarot rank and suit are determined by. Although, I don't see it as that big of an encroachment on my tarot practice because the chance of reversing a card in the 52-card system is rarely 50/50 anyway: it depends on how many red cards and how many black cards have already been drawn.</p>
